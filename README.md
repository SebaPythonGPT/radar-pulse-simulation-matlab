## Simulation Details

### Parameters

The radar simulation requires various parameters, including:

- **Pulse Width**: Duration of each pulse.
- **Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF)**: Rate at which pulses are transmitted.
- **Operating Frequency**: Frequency of the radar signal.
- **Detection Threshold**: Minimum signal level for target detection.

Adjust these parameters in the `run_simulation.m` file to tailor the simulation to your needs.

### Target Detection

The project implements several algorithms for target detection, including:

- **Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR)**: Adjusts the detection threshold based on noise levels.
- **Swerling Models**: Models target behavior under different conditions.

Experiment with different algorithms to see how they affect detection performance.

## Visualization

The simulation includes visualization tools for better understanding of radar data:

- **PPI Display**: Presents the radar data in a polar plot.
- **A-Scope**: Shows the signal strength over time for a specific range.

To visualize the results, call the `visualize_results.m` function after running the simulation.
